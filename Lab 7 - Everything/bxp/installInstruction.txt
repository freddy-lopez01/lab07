P3BXP-INTEL.tgz and P3BXP-ARM.tgz are available on Canvas. You should download the
archive appropriate to your architecture; extract the contents of the archive - it will create a bxp
directory in your current directory when you invoke tar. cd into bxp, then issue the following
three commands to bash:
$ sudo make installheaders
$ sudo make installlibrary
$ sudo make installmanpages
